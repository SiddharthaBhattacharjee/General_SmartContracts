# My General purpose smart contracts:

These are some general purpose smart contracts I have created using Remix ide.<br>
Remix is a great ide to write, and test solidity smart contracts without having to worry about any UI integration.<br>

This is an effort to learn more about solidity and improve my smart contracts by practissing.
